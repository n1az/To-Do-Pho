# To-Do-Pho
It is a simple To-Do app which enables you to add your things to do and cross or delete them when you want to organize your daily works.
Its beautiful minimal design makes it look really CLEAN to me.
It's my very first web app in Django, so be patient.

I used:
* Django 3.0.4
* Python 3.8
* HTML 5
* Bootstrap 4.4
